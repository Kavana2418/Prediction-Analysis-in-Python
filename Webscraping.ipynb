      "Headline: UK Pavilion, 3rd Largest country pavilion at SEMICON Taiwan\n",
      "\n",
      "Content: The UK’s dedication to supporting and empowering tech innovators remains strong. The UK Pavilion showcases the dynamic potential of Britain’s thriving tech sector and embodies our commitment to learning from and collaborating with Taiwan’s renowned semiconductor industry.  \n",
      "John Dennis, Representative at the British Office Taipei said:\n",
      "We continue to leverage the UK’s world-class expertise across the semiconductor supply chain, fostering innovation and strengthening international ties. Today is not just about inaugurating a pavilion; it is about paving the way for future collaborations between the UK and Taiwan. As global leaders in technology and innovation, with complementary strengths in the semiconductor sector, the UK and Taiwan are natural partners.\n",
      "Dr Dave Smith, the UK’s National Technology Adviser said:\n",
      "Taiwan is undoubtedly a powerhouse in advanced semiconductors manufacturing, and one of our top priority markets to support increased cooperation on semiconductors. Throughout my time here, I have been struck by the unique strengths and qualities that the UK and Taiwan bring to one another.  The UK has strengths across the entire semiconductor industry, with three particular areas of strategic advantage – our world-leading research and innovation system, our open market, and our technology ecosystem – and we want to work with likeminded partners like Taiwan to build on these advantages for mutual benefit. \n",
      "UK semiconductor research publication ranked 4th globally in 2019-2020, and areas of research strength include advanced packaging, advanced materials, and silicon photonics. The UK is also home to 140 design companies and CSConnected, the world’s first compound semiconductor cluster located in South Wales.  \n",
      "The UK Pavilion offers various opportunities to gain insights into the UK semiconductor industry. An introduction to the whole UK Delegation, where every participating UK company delivering a 3-minute pitch, will be hosted by Innovate UK, the UK’s innovation agency on 4 Sep, and there will be in-depth focus sessions on the following 2 days on compound semiconductors, photonics, memory, equipment, testing, manufacturing and materials.\n",
      "Visit the UK Pavilion to learn more about the UK semiconductor industry by this Friday, 6 September.\n",
      "Opening time: Now until 4 pm, Friday, 6 September \n",
      "Location: Booth K2660, 1ST Floor, TaiNEX 1, Taipei\n",

      "Content: The councils have each failed to meet the outcomes ofRSH’s new consumer standards and they have been given a C3 grading, meaning there are serious failings that they need to address.\n",
      "After carrying out responsive investigations into each council,RSHfound that:\n",

      "North Yorkshire Council:\n",
      "Warwick District Council:\n",
      "All three local authorities are engaging constructively withRSHand working to address these issues promptly. In the case of North Yorkshire and Warwick District, they are required to manage and mitigate risks to tenants’ safety as a priority andRSHis engaging intensively with them as they carry out this work.\n",
      "Kate Dodsworth, Chief of Regulatory Engagement atRSH, said:\n",
      "It is the responsibility of the landlord to take a proactive approach to providing safe and decent homes for tenants. Health and safety must be a top priority and keeping up-to-date, accurate data is a key part of this . We are working constructively with all three local authorities as they put things right for their tenants.\n",
      "All landlords should refer themselves to us if they are not meeting the outcomes of our standards, rather than wait for an inspection. This allows issues to be identified – and resolved – promptly. They must also ensure they collect TSMs, which gives tenants the information they need to scrutinise their landlord.\n",
      "In addition,RSHhas removed a July 2022 regulatory notice for Incommunities Limited. The landlord had failed to meet the outcomes of the rent standard and it has now resolved these issues.\n",

      "Both failed to use the funds to support their businesses, filed suspicious accounts with Companies House and used people’s identities unlawfully\n",
      "The companies were wound-up at the High Court following investigations by the Insolvency Service\n",
      "Two connected companies which fraudulently received more than £1 million in Covid support loans have been shut down by the courts following an investigation by the Insolvency Service.\n",
      "Ledbridge Consultants Limited and Montague Partners Ltd, which had registered offices in Birmingham and London, were wound-up at the High Court in London on Tuesday 10 September.\n",
      "Insolvency Service investigations into both Ledbridge Consultants and Montague Partners concluded that both had never genuinely traded and were used as fronts for obtaining large amounts of money.\n",
      "Cheryl Lambert, Chief Investigator at the Insolvency Service, said:\n",
      "Taxpayers’ money from Covid support schemes was drained from company bank accounts and no evidence was provided that the funds were ever used for the business themselves.\n",
      "The allegations against Ledbridge Consultants and Montague Partners were extremely serious which is why it was important for us to apply to stop them from trading with immediate effect.\n",
      "The two companies, which claimed to be financial intermediaries and management consultants respectively, each falsely secured £50,000 Bounce Back Loans, the maximum allowed under the terms of the scheme designed to support businesses through the pandemic.\n",
      "Payments worth £1.5 million from the Future Fund - another government Covid support scheme - were also paid into Montague Partners’ bank account after being obtained in the names of three other companies.\n",
      "The £1.5 million paid into Montague Partners’ account was paid out to 35 individuals within a short space of time. Ten of the 35 beneficiaries received more than £75,000, spread out over numerous smaller transactions.\n",
      "Similarly, the £50,000 Bounce Back Loan paid into Ledbridge Consultants’ bank account in May 2020 was paid out to a number of individuals and companies within a matter of weeks.\n",
      "By the following month, Ledbridge Consultants had nothing in their account.\n",
      "However, just one year later, the company filed accounts at Companies House showing their total net assets had increased by £13.4 million between February and August 2021.\n",
      "Montague Partners also filed suspicious accounts showing total net assets of £2.2 million in November 2020, compared to £1 for the previous accounting period to November 2019.\n",
      "Insolvency Service investigations also indicated that both Ledbridge Consultants and Montague Partners had used the identities of people who had applied for jobs online to set up companies without their knowledge or consent. They also used their personal data to register them as directors, shareholders, or investors in the two companies and to file suspicious documents with Companies House.\n",
      "Ledbridge Consultants and Montague Partners failed to co-operate with the Insolvency Service, meaning investigators were unable to determine who controlled the companies and the purpose of significant payments made from their bank accounts.\n",
      "The Official Receiver has been appointed as liquidator of both companies.\n",
      "All enquiries concerning the affairs of Ledbridge Consultants and Montague Partners should be made to the Official Receiver of the Public Interest Unit: 16th Floor, 1 Westfield Avenue, Stratford, London, E20 1HZ.Email: piu.or@insolvency.gov.uk.\n",

      "Headline: Canford Magna incinerator permit sought by MVV Environment Ltd\n",
      "Content: The Environment Agency has today launched a consultation into an environmental permit application for an incinerator in Canford Magna.\n",
      "MVV Environment Ltd has applied for the permit to operate an incinerator on the Canford Resource Park and has separately also applied to Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council for planning permission.\n",
      "The company wants to burn up to 260,000 tonnes of non-hazardous waste each year in an incinerator known as an Energy from Waste Combined Heat and Power facility.\n",
      "The proposed facility will burn waste to produce energy in the form of electricity. Power from this process will be exported to the National Grid.\n",
      "An environmental permit sets the conditions which MVV Environment Ltd must meet when operating the proposed incinerator.  It covers the management and operation of the site and the control and monitoring of emissions.\n",
      "Issues that we consider in deciding on the permit are:\n",
      "The Environment Agency will consult with partner organisations, including the UK Health Security Agency, as part of the process.\n",
      "Issues such as suitability of the site, operating hours and traffic management to and from it, are matters for the planning authority, not the Environment Agency. The Environment Agency can only consider issues covered by the environmental permit and can only refuse a permit application based on technical information.   However, in order to build and operate the proposed incinerator, the company will need to be granted both planning permission and an environmental permit.\n",
      "To obtain an environmental permit, the company will need to show they are putting in place the necessary measures to meet current standards to protect human health and the environment. In addition, they must explain how any risks that are identified, such as odour and emissions, are prevented or minimised, alongside producing a Fire Prevention Plan.\n",
      "Once the consultation closes, the Environment Agency will review all the comments received before reaching a draft decision. MVV Environment Ltd has the right to appeal if the permit is refused. If the Environment Agency thinks it is likely to issue the permit, it will consult again on the draft permit and draft decision document, so you can comment on the conditions to be included in the permit.\n",
      "If you wish to make comments about the application, please do so by 23.59 on 27 October, 2024.\n",
      "You can comment by:\n",
      "If you need help accessing this consultation in another format, or would like to be added to the mailing list for this application, please contact us by emailing:wessexenquiries@environment-agency.gov.ukor call 03708 506506.\n",

      "Content: Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds or with SEND will get targeted support to unlock their musical potential, thanks to a new scheme designed to break down the barriers to opportunity and advance their talents.\n",
      "The government’s Music Opportunities Pilot will expand on Young Sounds UK’s existing programme – Young Sounds Connect – which offers pupils across primary and secondary schools the opportunity to learn to play an instrument of their choice or how to sing to a high standard by providing free lessons and supporting young people to progress, including taking music exams.\n",
      "Backed by £5.8million, co-funded by the government and partners including Young Sounds UK, Arts Council England and Youth Music, the programme aims to inspire the next generation of British musicians across twelve areas including Sunderland, Bury, Bradford and Stoke on Trent to help ensure the arts remain a cornerstone of the nation’s identity.\n",
      "From the roaring crowds at Glastonbury to intimate performances at local venues, music is the beating heart of British culture, shaping society, enriching lives and fuelling a creative economy that is the envy of the world.\n",
      "Culture is an essential part of supporting children and young people to develop creativity and find their voice. There is huge potential for growth in the creative industries that benefit every corner of the UK, and the industries are worth £125 billion in economic value to the UK, employing 2.4 million people in 2022.\n",
      "School Standards Minister, Catherine McKinnell said:\n",
      "“The arts are one of the most important ways to help children and young people to develop creativity and find their voice. Music opportunities should be available to all pupils – no matter their background or circumstance.\n",
      "“Following a summer filled with vibrant festivals and creative acts that filled the streets with energy, it’s clear the role music plays in enriching lives. By investing in our young people we not only nurture individual talent, but also secure the future of the UK’s rich music scene by fostering a deep appreciation for music from an early age.\n",
      "“Alongside our Curriculum and Assessment Review, the Music Opportunities pilot will help break down the barriers to opportunity by widening access to the arts for more young people across the country.”\n",
      "Hester Cockcroft, Chief Executive of Young Sounds UK said:\n",
      "“Young Sounds Connect is designed to help young people from low-income families lead their own musical learning after whole-class lessons end, connecting them to funding, opportunities and each other, so they can keep on progressing as musicians. 15 years since it was first piloted, we’re delighted to be able to supercharge the programme model over the next four years through the Music Opportunities Pilot.\n",
      "“Collaborating with parents/carers, music educators, and an amazing group of Music Hubs and national partners, we’ll continue to learn together, and share our learning, so that many more young people’s musical lives can flourish in the future.”\n",
      "Arts Minister Sir Chris Bryant said:\n",
      "“Music should never be the preserve of a privileged few. I want everyone to have a chance to realise their talent regardless of their background.\n",
      "“This support will help to make sure that every child has access to high-quality creative education, with the opportunity to learn musical skills that may become the foundation of a lifelong passion or a future star of the UK arts scene.”\n",
      "Supporting young people to become musicians is invaluable in various creative and other industries. It fuels innovation and excellence in the broader creative landscape, contributing to the UK’s world class reputation as a global hub for the arts.\n",
      "The pilot scheme will run over four years and is jointly funded by a £2 million investment from the Department for Education and £3.85 million funding from Young Sounds UK and its partners. Young Sounds UK will work in collaboration with local Music Hub partners that support and enable access to music education for children and young people in England in order to deliver the programme.\n",
      "The government’sCurriculum and Assessment Reviewhas also been launched to drive high and rising standards for all pupils and tackle the barriers which hold them back, including pupils with SEND. As part of the review, it will seek to deliver a broader curriculum so that children and young people do not miss out on creative subjects such as music, art and drama, as well as sport.\n",
      "By re-establishing the arts as an integral part of the curriculum the government is raising the status of studying creative subjects and the creative industry, ensuring the arts remain a powerful force in shaping the nation’s future.\n",

      "Author: Competition and Markets Authority\n",
      "Headline: CMA sets out provisional view on Vodafone / Three merger\n",
      "Content: An in-depth investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally found competition concerns over Vodafone’s planned merger with Three in the UK.\n",
      "The investigation, led by an independent inquiry group, has provisionally concluded that the merger would lead to price increases for tens of millions of mobile customers, or see customers get a reduced service such as smaller data packages in their contracts. The CMA has particular concerns that higher bills or reduced services would negatively affect those customers least able to afford mobile services as well as those who might have to pay more for improvements in network quality they do not value.\n",
      "The CMA has also provisionally found that the merger would negatively impact ‘wholesale’ telecoms customers – Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) such as Lyca Mobile, Sky Mobile and Lebara – which rely on the existing network operators to provide their own mobile services. The merger would reduce the number of network operators from 4 to 3 making it more difficult for MVNOs to secure competitive terms, restricting their ability to offer the best deals to retail customers.\n",
      "While identifying these concerns, the CMA has also found that the merger, by integrating the Vodafone and Three networks, could improve the quality of mobile networks and bring forward the deployment of next generation 5G networks and services, as claimed by Vodafone and Three. But the CMA currently considers that these claims are overstated, and that the merged firm would not necessarily have the incentive to follow through on its proposed investment programme after the merger.\n",
      "As a result, the CMA has provisionally concluded that the merger would lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the UK – in both retail and wholesale mobile markets.\n",
      "The CMA will now consult on its provisional findings. It will also consult on potential solutions to its competition concerns, including the options set out in its remedies notice (also published today). These include legally binding investment commitments overseen by the sector regulator, and measures to protect both retail customers and customers in the wholesale market. The CMA will retain the option to prohibit the merger should it conclude that other remedy options will not address its competition concerns effectively.\n",
      "Stuart McIntosh, chair of the inquiry group leading the investigation, said:\n",
      "We’ve taken a thorough, considered approach to investigating this merger, weighing up the investment the companies say they will make in enhancing network quality and boosting 5G connectivity against the significant costs to customers and rival virtual networks.\n",
      "We will now consider how Vodafone and Three might address our concerns about the likely impact of the merger on retail and wholesale customers while securing the potential longer-term benefits of the merger, including by guaranteeing future network investments.\n",
      "The CMA welcomes responses to its provisional findings by 04 October 2024 and its notice of possible remedies by 27 September 2024. These will be considered ahead of the CMA issuing its final report, which is due by 7 December 2024.\n",

      "Content: New changes to the law will force tech firms to clamp down on the sharing of non-consensual intimate images on their platforms as part of a drive to tackle online sexual offending.\n",
      "The offence of sharing intimate images without consent will be classified as the most serious type of online offences under theOnline Safety Act, meaning platforms will now have to take steps to proactively remove this material, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place. If they fail to do so under this new law they could face fines.\n",
      "The strengthening of the law forms part of the government’s commitment to ensure new and existing technologies are safely developed and help keep people safer online, particularly women and girls with more than one in three women in the UK having experienced abuse online.\n",

      "Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said:\n",
      "The rise in intimate image abuse online is utterly intolerable. As well as being devastating for victims these crimes have also contributed to the creation of a misogynistic culture on social media that can spread into potentially dangerous relationships offline. We must tackle these crimes from every angle, including their origins online, ensuring tech companies step up and play their part.\n",
      "That is why we will classify these vile and cowardly offences as the most severe types of crime under the Online Safety Act. Social media firms will face extra legal obligations – backed up by big fines – to uproot this content from their sites, helping to stop their normalisation and preventing generations becoming desensitised to their damaging effects.\n",
      "Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips said:\n",
      "Intimate image abuse is an appalling, invasive crime and technology companies must do much more to tackle it. We will use every tool available to achieve our unprecedented mission of halving violence against women and girls within a decade and this is an important step forward.\n",
      "The scale of violence against women and girls in all its forms is a national emergency, whether in person or online. We must overhaul every aspect of society’s response to stop this abuse from happening in the first place. Platforms must take responsibility for the content they host and we must ensure victims receive the support they deserve.\n",
      "Victims Minister Alex Davies-Jones said:\n",
      "Intimate image abuse is a degrading and deeply misogynistic crime and we must pull all levers available to us to stamp it out.\n",
      "Today’s announcement builds on the progress which has already been made, making it a specific offence to share intimate images online without consent. It also sends a clear message to those companies who turn a blind eye to such heinous content on their platforms – remove it without delay or face the full force of the law.\n",
      "The Online Safety Act will require social media firms and search services to protect their users from illegal material on their sites, with protections due to come into force from Spring next year. The most serious forms of illegal content are classed as ‘priority offences’ meaning regulated online platforms will have additional duties to proactively remove and stop from appearing on their sites.\n",
      "Today’s move will mean intimate image offences are treated as priority offences under the Act, putting them on the same footing as public order offences and the sale of weapons and drugs online.\n",
      "If firms fail to comply with their duties the regulatorOfcomwill have robust enforcement powers, including imposing fines that could reach up to 10% of qualifying worldwide revenue.\n",
      "Georgia Harrison, journalist and advocate for online safety and the prevention of violence against women and girls, said:\n",
      "I am proud to be part of the announcement that intimate image abuse will now be recognised as a priority offence.\n",
      "As a victim of voyeurism and image-based sexual abuse, what shocked me the most is that certain platforms were not only spreading and advertising this harmful content but also legally monetising it.\n",
      "This new legislation could have shielded me from such exploitation and, more importantly, validated that my voice matters. I earnestly hope tech companies will take this seriously and implement meaningful changes to their algorithms and corporate policies to prevent this type of abuse.\n",

      "Content: Knife crime has impacted me in ways I can’t explain. It’s forced me to grow up and deal with situations I shouldn’t have had to deal with at such a young age.\n",
      "I’m 20 now, but I’ve been losing friends constantly since I was 17. When I hear someone has been stabbed, I think: oh my god, is it someone in my family? Is it one of my friends?\n",
      "Imagine you losing your child or your friend to a knife, and how damaging that is. Imagine not being able to see them again because their life has been taken from them by someone else. That has become my reality, it’s what I am used to now.\n",
      "I originally started working with Empire Fighting Chance because my brother took his own life. We’re a charity which uses non-contact boxing to inspire young people to reach their full potential, and my journey with them started because I wanted to help young people who were in the same situation as him, and me.\n",
      "Over time, I began losing more and more people in my life to knife crime. But the trigger for me was losing Eddie, one of my best friends growing up.\n",
      "Eddie King Muthemba Kinuthia and I had been friends since we were three years old. We were always together. We went to the same nursery and primary school. For a while we went to the same secondary school. As we got older, we drifted slightly, but the love was still there.\n",
      "He was a really kind person; everyone in our community knew him, and they knew him for the right things. Ever since he died, so many people he knew have tried to honour him in some way, because he was such an important person to so many, and such a good role model.\n",
      "To have to speak about him in the past tense is crazy. I still can’t believe that he’s gone.\n",
      "We’re still seeking justice for Eddie, but after losing him I thought, okay I need to do something. This is getting out of hand. I don’t want to see another person I love die.\n",
      "Since then, I have continued to work with Empire and deliver boxing lessons for free every week to young men who may be involved in knife crime, drug dealing, or any situation that could lead to those things happening.\n",
      "I work with various organisations which enable me to speak with young people about their experiences with the system and crime and what they would like to change, and I am starting my own youth group, where we come together every fortnight and talk about what we want to change, which I hope can grow and develop over time.\n",
      "I believe we’re not hearing from young people enough.\n",
      "We need to be inviting young people to events like today, to places like Downing Street, so they know that their voices are heard. I am so grateful for the opportunity I have been given, but we need to give more young people the platform to share their views.\n",
      "Attending events like the Knife Crime Summit will help – even being invited has probably changed my life. If I look back to five years ago, I could have gone down a very different path where I was involved in knife crime.\n",
      "A lot of the young people I work with ask me: “How did you go from there to where you are today?”\n",
      "Just inviting one young person like me here could have a domino effect on other young people.\n",
      "I believe it’s important for the right legislation to be in place – that change is good - but we need to focus on immediate action. It’s getting to the point where someone is dying every day.\n",
      "In my opinion, it’s also about the little things we can do that don’t cost money. Around that table today there were so many role models – Idris Elba, the Prime Minister, loads of MPs – and it is so important to see them supporting organisations like mine, because it can inspire young people.\n",
      "I was a young person who didn’t believe that I could do anything. Then I met Marvin Rees, who was Mayor of Bristol at the time, and Martin Bisp, the Chief Executive of Empire. They are the reason I am here today.\n",
      "They showed me that I can come to places like this, I can speak about issues like this, and I can have that domino effect on other young people who feel they don’t have a voice.\n",

      "Headline: Nuclear safeguards: AUKUS statement to the IAEA Board of Governors, September 2024\n",
      "Content: Chair,\n",
      "I take the floor on behalf of the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States to respond to comments made regarding Australia’s acquisition of a naval nuclear propulsion capability through the AUKUS partnership. We are again compelled to invoke our Right of Reply to address remarks that purposefully mischaracterise AUKUS partners’ intentions and attempt to undermine the independence, integrity, and authority of the IAEA. Under this item, the Board has repeatedly heard unsubstantiated claims that ignore or misrepresent the information we have provided in good faith, and assertions that disregard the statements made by the Director General.\n",
      "I reiterate that this matter has not been adopted as a standing agenda item by this Board and has never enjoyed consensus support. It is regrettable that this unnecessary item has been added to the agenda for nearly three years, at the insistence of one member state, when there are pressing non-proliferation concerns requiring the Board’s attention.\n",
      "Director General Grossi has expressed his satisfaction with AUKUS partners’ engagement and transparency and reiterated that he will continue to update the Board on naval nuclear propulsion as appropriate. The AUKUS partners have continued to engage consistently, openly, and transparently with Member States and the Secretariat on genuine questions, including at the 2023 and 2024 NPT Preparatory Committees. Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States have provided updates on relevant progress at all Board meetings since the initial AUKUS announcement in September 2021. We will do so again at this meeting under Any Other Business, where it remains most appropriate.\n",
      "Chair,\n",
      "The Director General has already provided clear answers to questions raised today and in previous meetings, including in his reports on Australia’s naval nuclear propulsion program to the Board:\n",
      "Naval nuclear propulsion was foreseen by the drafters of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Article 14 of the IAEA’s draft Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (CSA) is the specific provision to support the right of states to use nuclear material in a non-proscribed military activity, including for naval nuclear propulsion, within the safeguards framework.\n",
      "The IAEA has the clear authority, under the IAEA Statute, as agreed by 178 Member States, to negotiate directly with Member States on the establishment, and application, of safeguards and verification arrangements – including those pertaining to naval nuclear propulsion. The NPT, IAEA Statute, Australia’s CSA, and Additional Protocol provide a firm legal basis for Australia to engage with the IAEA on the safeguards and verification approach for this program.\n",
      "The Director General has clearly stated that the Agency has “the necessary experience to develop the arrangements related to the use of nuclear material for naval nuclear propulsion in accordance with the Statute and relevant safeguards agreements.” Despite these statements, it is concerning that some states persistently question the Director General’s ability to perform the functions vested in him by the Statute, by the relevant safeguards agreements, and by decisions of the Board.\n",
      "It is untrue that the transfer of high enriched uranium from a nuclear-weapon State to a non-nuclear-weapon State runs counter to the spirit of the NPT. The transfer of nuclear material at any enrichment level to a non-nuclear-weapon State, is not prohibited by the NPT and indeed such transfers have regularly taken place with IAEA oversight.\n",
      "Under the Article 14 arrangement, the IAEA will maintain oversight of nuclear material. Australia’s Article 14 arrangement will include a package of robust verification measures that will enable the IAEA to continue to meet its technical safeguards objectives throughout the submarines’ lifecycle. Once the Article 14 arrangement is developed, the Director General will transmit it to the Board for ‘appropriate action’ - as we have said many times before. To suggest that the Board will somehow be bypassed is categorically false.\n",
      "We would also like to draw the Board’s attention to the recent signing and publication of the AUKUS Agreement for Cooperation Related to Naval Nuclear Provision. Upon entry into force, this Agreement will reaffirm Australia’s obligations under the NPT and make Australia’s other key non-proliferation commitments legally binding conditions for AUKUS partners’ ongoing cooperation. Importantly, under the Agreement, Australia cannot receive any nuclear material from the UK or the US for use in naval nuclear propulsion prior to having an Article 14 Agreement in place.\n",
      "Chair,\n",
      "Our three countries – along with the majority of this Board – continue to oppose any proposal for this item to be a standing agenda item or to establish any efforts that undermine and politicise the independent technical mandate of the IAEA. We encourage colleagues to continue to reject deliberate efforts to undermine the Agency’s independence and integrity.\n",
      "We will continue to engage in good faith with Member States on genuine questions, consistent with our approach to maintaining open and transparent engagement, and welcome the Director General’s continued commitment to provide updates on naval nuclear propulsion, as he deems appropriate.\n",
      "Thank you, Chair.\n",

      "Las personas interesadas podrán realizar su solicitud, y obtener una respuesta en un plazo de tres días hábiles, mediante la “aplicación ETA del Reino Unido”, que se puede descargar desde Google Play o Apple App Store, o bien a través del portal de internetGOV.UK.\n",
      "Por su parte, las personas que necesiten una visa del Reino Unido para vivir, trabajar o estudiar en el Reino Unido ahora recibirán una visa electrónica, que proporciona prueba digital de su estatus migratorio, en lugar de documentos de inmigración físicos. Las visas electrónicas significan que las personas ya no tienen que esperar ni viajar para recoger un documento físico, lo que simplifica su experiencia.\n",

La mayoría de los BRP vencerán el 31 de diciembre de 2024, y se insta a los titulares de BRP a tomar medidas antes de que expire.\n",
      "La creación de la cuenta permite a las personas utilizar servicios en línea para demostrar sus derechos y administrar sus datos, incluida la información personal y de su pasaporte, y no afectará su estado migratorio subyacente. A través de financiación gubernamental, se brinda apoyo adicional a las personas vulnerables que necesitan tomar medidas para pasar de documentos físicos a una visa electrónica.\n",

      "First, I join the briefers in highlighting the plight of UN, NGO workers and staff and former staff of diplomatic missions who remain in Houthi captivity.\n",
      "It is over three months since their detention; that’s three months of families being torn apart by the unprovoked and arbitrary act; and three months of reducing the humanitarian community’s capacity to be able to fully support Yemenis in need. There is no justification for this. We once again call on the Houthis to immediately and unconditionally release those detained.\n",
      "Second, I join Ms Msuya in highlighting the severe constraints on humanitarian access in Yemen especially in Houthi-controlled areas. The reckless actions of the Houthis are further restricting an already complex and hostile operating environment, making it almost impossible to get aid to those who need it.\n",
      "We must all be clear about the importance of safe and effective humanitarian access so that we can continue to deliver critical, lifesaving support to the Yemeni people.\n",
      "Third, we once again reiterate this Council’s call for the Houthis to cease their dangerous and illegal attacks on maritime shipping.\n",
      "The recent attack on the MV Sounion is a clear example of the Houthis’ disregard for the catastrophic environmental and economic consequences of their actions for both Yemen and the region.\n",
      "We call for the immediate cessation of arms supplies to Houthis. The continued supply of advanced weapons which enables these attacks shows complete disregard for the UN Arms Embargo.\n",
      "President, to conclude, the UK is grateful to Special Envoy Grundberg’s efforts to facilitate economic dialogue, de-escalate tensions and preserve space for a future peace process.\n",
      "We are unwavering in our support to his efforts to secure an inclusive, sustainable peace in Yemen and we continue to call on all parties to de-escalate tensions and preserve space for negotiations under UN auspices.\n",
      "Rather than pursuing reckless attacks and the detention of innocent civilians, we urge the Houthis to prioritise the needs of Yemenis by engaging with peace process negotiations.\n",
